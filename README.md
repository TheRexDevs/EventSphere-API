## Key Features

### User Management System

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was implementing a robust user management system that could handle different types of users within a college environment. I developed:

- **Multi-role Authentication**: Support for Admin, Organizer, Participant, and Visitor roles
- **JWT-based Security**: Secure token-based authentication with refresh capabilities
- **Profile Management**: Comprehensive user profiles with contact information
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles

### Event Management

The core functionality revolves around event management. I implemented:

- **Event Creation**: Rich event creation with detailed information and categorization
- **Media Upload**: Support for featured images and gallery images with Cloudinary integration
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous image uploads to ensure fast response times
- **Event Status Management**: Draft, Published, Pending, Approved, and Cancelled states

### Registration & Attendance

Managing event registrations and attendance was crucial for the system's effectiveness:

- **Seamless Registration**: Easy event registration with status tracking
- **Attendance Tracking**: QR code-based attendance marking system
- **Capacity Management**: Intelligent capacity limits and waitlist functionality

### Certificate Generation

As a final year project, I wanted to include something that would add real value to users:

- **PDF Certificates**: Automated certificate generation using ReportLab
- **Cloud Storage**: Secure certificate storage on Cloudinary
- **Event Completion**: Automatic certificate issuance upon event completion

### Technical Features

Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing industry-standard practices:

- **RESTful API**: Well-designed REST API following industry standards
- **FormData Support**: Dual support for JSON and FormData requests for file uploads
- **Background Processing**: Thread-based background tasks for performance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting for security and performance

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework

For this project, I chose technologies that would both challenge me technically and provide a solid foundation for a production-ready application:

- **Python 3.12**: Modern Python version with enhanced performance
- **Flask 3.0.1**: Lightweight and flexible web framework that gave me full control over the architecture
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1.1**: Powerful ORM for database operations, which I found much more intuitive than raw SQL
- **Flask-JWT-Extended 4.6.0**: Robust JWT token management for secure authentication

### Database & Storage

One of the biggest learning experiences was working with different storage solutions:

- **PostgreSQL 15**: Reliable relational database for production, much more powerful than SQLite
- **SQLite**: Development and testing database - perfect for local development
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based media storage and optimization, which simplified file handling significantly

### API & Validation

I spent considerable time learning about API design and validation:

- **Pydantic 2.8.2**: Data validation and serialization - incredibly helpful for maintaining data integrity
- **Flask-Pydantic-Spec 0.8.6**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation, which made API testing much easier
- **Flask-CORS 4.0.0**: Cross-origin resource sharing, essential for frontend integration

### Additional Libraries

These libraries were crucial for specific functionality:

- **ReportLab 4.0.7**: PDF generation for certificates - quite challenging to implement but very satisfying
- **Pillow 11.3.0**: Image processing capabilities for handling uploads
- **python-slugify**: URL-friendly string generation for clean URLs

### Installation

Setting up the development environment was one of the first major hurdles I overcame. Here's how I did it:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/eventsphere-backend.git
cd eventsphere-backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize database
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# Seed database with sample data
python seed_data.py

# Run development server
python run.py
```

### Test API

Once everything is set up, you can test that the API is working:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/version
```

## API Overview

### Authentication Endpoints

The authentication system was one of the first components I implemented. It handles user registration, login, and token management:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/register    # User registration
POST /api/v1/auth/login       # User login
GET  /api/v1/auth/me          # Get current user
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh     # Refresh JWT token
```

### Event Management

The core of the application revolves around event management. I designed these endpoints to be intuitive and comprehensive:

```http
GET    /api/v1/events                    # List public events
GET    /api/v1/events/{id}              # Get event details
POST   /api/v1/events/{id}/register     # Register for event
POST   /api/v1/admin/events             # Create event (admin/organizer)
PUT    /api/v1/admin/events/{id}        # Update event
DELETE /api/v1/admin/events/{id}        # Delete event
```

### Admin Features

As a final year student, I wanted to demonstrate my understanding of administrative systems:

```http
GET    /api/v1/admin/users              # User management
GET    /api/v1/admin/users/stats        # User statistics
PUT    /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/roles   # Update user roles
GET    /api/v1/admin/events             # Event management
POST   /api/v1/admin/events/{id}/approve # Approve events
```

### Advanced Features

These features showcase the more complex functionality I implemented:

```http
POST   /api/v1/admin/events/{id}/certificates        # Generate certificates
GET    /api/v1/admin/events/{id}/attendance          # Attendance tracking
POST   /api/v1/admin/events/{id}/attendance          # Mark attendance
GET    /api/v1/admin/feedback/stats                  # Feedback analytics
```

## Final Reflections

EventSphere represents the culmination of my final year studies in computer science. This project challenged me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems, from designing scalable architectures to implementing secure authentication systems.

The experience taught me valuable lessons about software development, from the importance of proper planning and documentation to the challenges of integrating multiple technologies. Working with technologies like Flask, PostgreSQL, and Cloudinary has given me practical experience that I can carry forward into my professional career.
